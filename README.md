## Mandatory extra steps

### Things to consider when creating a Google Maps API key.
Google Maps APIs will be used in the sample application. You need to generate api keys for Android and Ios. For your safety, pay attention to the following items.<br/>

- You need to create a Google payment account. (It is free until a certain request.)
- When creating your API key, do not forget to add application filters and API filters to be used.
- Store the API keys in the .env file.

### Completion of integrations.
Some of the packages we added as dependencies to the project require installation. Complete the installation of these packages by reviewing their documentation.<br/><br/>
**Note:** The **react-native-config** package is already configured to set environment variables. You can skip this package.<br/>
**Note:** Use your api keys with **react-native-config**. You can learn how to do this from the package documentation.<br/>


## What needs to be done?
- Navigation configuration with **React Navigation**.
- Theme configuration with **React Navigation**.
- Global state configuration with **Redux**.
- Form operations with **Yup** and **Formik**.
- Map operations with **React Native Map**.


## What will be evaluated?
